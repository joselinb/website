  <h5>Review:</h5> <h6>This new Toy Story movie focuses on Woody and a new toy...Forky! As Woody tries to find his purpose he cares for Forky and tries to teach him to care for Bonnie. Although it seems that this might be the last time we hear from Disney's Toy Story, it sure did pull at our heartstrings saying goodbye to Woody.</h6>

  <h5>Review:</h5> <h6>I expected something completely different based off of the trailers I had watched. (Check out the trailer I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uhd3lo_IWJc"target="_blank">here!</a>) I definitely laughed lots, but the amount of plot twists were insane. If you want to have a good laugh and just watch something that many can relate to (it's very scary to possibly have wasted your life away in high school without having any fun...) watch Booksmart!</h6>

  <h5>Review:</h5> <h6><strong>D E V A S T A T E D</strong>...that's how I felt after finishing binge watching season 3 of Stranger Things. I honestly fell in love with Alexei (his death took a great toll on me) and Hopper's death was so unexpected. I hate how the end of every episode hooks you in and leaves you just wanting to start the next one. There was so much action and emotion packed into just 8 episodes. Stranger Things never dissapoints. </h6>
